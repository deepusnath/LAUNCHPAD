### About Me

Hi, I'm Afna Ayshu Jaffin, a final-year CSE student pursuing my Bachelor's degree. With a strong passion for technology, I have actively participated in several hackathons, gaining hands-on experience in software development. I was awarded a special mention for GDG Cloud Kochi's AI Adapt Search competition on Kaggle, which further fueled my interest in the field of artificial intelligence. I possess a good grasp of the basics of programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java, and I'm currently learning React to develop my skills further.I am also a graphic designer. I use Abode Photoshop and Figma for the same. I am always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow in my field, and I believe that my enthusiasm and dedication make me a valuable asset to any project. Connect with me to explore exciting possibilities!

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I embarked on my leadership journey by joining the IEEE student branch executive committee (ExeCom) in my first year of college. I started as the electronics communication coordinator, where my responsibilities included creating, monitoring, and posting content for social media in a timely manner. After gaining experience in various design communities, I now hold the position of design mentor for the IEEE SB SJCET.

#### Networking:

- Building on my IEEE experience, I actively networked by participating in events like IEDC summits and hackathons (GDGC WoW). My positive and friendly approach helped me connect with fellow participants. Leading design communities at TinkerHub and UIPath Academic Alliance further expanded my network across colleges, fostering valuable connections with like-minded peers.
  
#### Career Plan:

- My career plan is : get a software or AI ML based job --> gain experience and expertise --> take first steps build my own agriculture related business -->  ​“Try Again. Fail Again. Fail Better.” until I see success --> go on excelling
- Immediate goal is to graduate B.Tech with an excellent GPA and to be placed on a company where I could gow.
- My long term goal is to be an entrepreneur.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala's tech startup ecosystem is poised for growth, fueled by a talented local workforce and a supportive government environment. To fully unlock this potential, fostering a culture of innovation and fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and government will be crucial.
