## Portfolio Highlights

### My Projects

Smart transportation solution for KSRTC
(Final Project)
It is a developing smart transportation solution to
enhance the efficiency of government-run buses. It
will provide real-time tracking of KSRTC buses using
GPS Modules and display it using Google Maps API.
Another feature is it also allows passengers to check
how many seats are occupied at any given time.

Fullstack Website Development Project
(Personal Project)
I spearheaded a full-stack website using Supabase,
PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
Achievements include modular architecture,
responsive design, user authentication, real-time
data sync, and performance optimization. This
project demonstrates expertise in modern web
technologies and meticulous attention to detail.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I have been a placement coordinator for my college giving me the privilage to conduct multiple on campus placements for my peers showcasing my leadership and organisation skills which are much needed in a team working environment.

- I have also worked as an intern for a virtual internship program conducted by Lyft where they simulate an environment their intern would have to go through.


#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala can excel in tech startups by nurturing talent, fostering innovation hubs, supporting STEM education, and promoting collaboration between academia, industry, and government. Simplified regulations and leveraging emerging technologies will further boost growth.
