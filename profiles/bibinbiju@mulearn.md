#### Leadership and Influence:

I've been the main coordinator for Asthra at our college fest twice and recently led a tech exhibition. I've also headed project teams a couple of times during my studies and showed my leadership chops in IEEE competitions. And outside the tech scene, I've captained my cricket team in inter-school championships.

#### Networking:

I've built solid connections not just online but also through platforms like MuLearn and LinkedIn, and through face-to-face chats. By staying engaged with peers and pros, I've grown my network and stayed in the loop about what's happening in the industry. Plus, I keep up with the latest in my field, proving my commitment to always learning and staying on top of things.

#### Career Plan:

My short-term goal is to excel in my B.Tech studies, aiming for a high GPA, and secure a position in a company where I can further develop my skills. Once employed, I aspire to gain valuable industry experience and understand the workings of various sectors. Looking ahead, my long-term ambition is to assume a leadership role within the software domain.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

By emphasizing innovation, investment, and nurturing a robust entrepreneurial culture, Kerala has the potential to evolve into a leading technology startup hub. This strategic focus will draw top talent, secure essential investments, and nurture a dynamic ecosystem, fostering ongoing innovation and development.
