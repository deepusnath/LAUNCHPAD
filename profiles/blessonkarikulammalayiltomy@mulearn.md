#### Leadership and Influence:

Explain how you meet the requirement for being a leader or influencer in your domain. Provide clear examples of your leadership and influencing skills.

While I have been a leader all my life, this is the first time that I am trying to be a leader in the tech sector. I encourage my classmates to sign up for competitions and workshops that are related to Computer Science. As the Class Representative, I created a Project Exhibition for Asthra this year where we encouraged our classmatess to build projects and showcase their work. As an active member of Mulearn, I also help students who are lost or confused in the Lobby Channel in the Discord Mulearn Server.

While I have not done much, I am certainly excited to do more and bring more people to be industry-oriented.

#### Networking:

As an active member of IEEE and Mulearn, I had the opportunity to meet with many people of different backgrounds, job status and experiences. Everyone I talk to has an important piece of advice to share that I always remember. As I meet people, I seek to learn from their experience and grow as an individual.

#### Career Plan:

I am currently considering my options. I would love to build a career for myself in software engineering, however there are also some other fields that I would like to explore. I am looking forward to see what life has in store for me and what sort of life I can create for myself. I am also looking for opportunites for internships and further education.

I am currently a member of an AI based tech start-up. We are working on branding and building at the moment. I am excited to see what 

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

I believe that organisations such as Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) are successfully working to increase the number of startups in Kerala. The introduction of activity points and other such initiatives by the universities to encourage students to innovate is also a step forward in the right path.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

I have participated in HACKTOBERFEST 2023 but am still relatively new to Open Source Contributions. However, I understand how important Open Source is for young developers like me who aim to learn and grow.

#### History of Community Engagement:

I write articles and contribute to the technical community on LinkedIn. My usual topics include Computer Science as well as Strategy.
