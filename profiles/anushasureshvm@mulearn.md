### About Me

> Hi, I'm Anusha Suresh VM, a engineering graduate of Electronics and Communication Engineering from Government Engineering College Wayanad with a notable CGPA of 8.03. I embarked on a journey to merge my technical acumen with real-world challenges. Following my graduation in 2023, I delved into the dynamic realm of software development as an intern at Kodnest Technologies Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, honing my skills in Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JDBC, HTML, CSS, React JS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Python.My professional journey has been marked by hands-on experiences that have honed my problem-solving skills, active listening abilities, and adaptability.
