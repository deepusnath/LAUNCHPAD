### About Me

> Hi, I am currently in the final year of my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering. My academic journey has
been marked by a keen interest in Machine Learning, and I have been actively engaged in understanding and 
applying various ML algorithms. My thirst for knowledge is insatiable, and I am always open to constructive 
feedback that aids in my continuous improvement. I understand the significance of networking for personal growth
and am eager to be an active participant in relevant communities. My technical skills include proficiency in coding 
languages such as C++, Python, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with the MySQL database. 
At the core of my pursuits is a deep-seated passion for problem-solving. I am driven by the desire to make 
meaningful contributions in this area and look forward to opportunities that allow me to do so.

#### Career Plan:

- My immediate career objective is to successfully complete my B.Tech degree and secure a position in the dynamic 
fields of Machine Learning or Software Development. 
- During this initial phase of my career, I am committed to 
enhancing my skill set, forging meaningful connections, and contributing to a team’s growth.
- As for my long-term aspirations, I envision myself as an entrepreneur, contributing to solving challenges that we face in our world.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- On how Kerala can excel in the Technology Startup Ecosystem for the future, I believe the key lies in nurturing homegrown talent, fostering an environment conducive to innovation and growth, and investing in public infrastructure.
- The world is currently witnessing a surge of technological innovations in various sectors such as health tech, agri-tech, bio tech, space tech, and climate tech. Unfortunately, school students in Kerala often have limited awareness of these advancements. This lack of knowledge can lead them to make career choices based on a narrow set of options they are familiar with, resulting in a lack of clear vision due to insufficient understanding.
- Exposure plays a pivotal role in influencing students’ career decisions. To foster a robust startup ecosystem in Kerala, it is imperative to inspire our young minds. We can achieve this by sharing stories of how startups are addressing various challenges and assuring them that they too can contribute to this change.
- Another crucial aspect is to cultivate a problem-solving oriented learning methodology. Students should be educated about the relevance and application of their learning. The transformation should commence at schools, where students are enlightened about the significance of their education and its practical implications in real-world scenarios.
- To cultivate a thriving talent ecosystem in Kerala, I believe it is also essential to foster an exceptional work culture, provide robust community support, and create ample opportunities for professional growth. These elements are crucial in retaining talent within the state. Furthermore, the development of superior public infrastructure is a necessity. Ensuring the consistent availability 
of key resources, such as clean air and clean water, is paramount. Additionally, it is vital to provide sufficient funding opportunities for startups aspiring to expand within Kerala. These initiatives will not only enhance the quality of life but also stimulate economic growth and innovation in our state. By focusing on these areas, Kerala can indeed excel in the Technology Startup Ecosystem for the future.
