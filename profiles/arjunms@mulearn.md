### About Me

>  I am a Curious Guy who loves to tinker with tech and to play football. Basically, I am a Python Developer but I don't want to limit myself to that one stack. I am the Author of [SQL-Ease](https://sqlease.buildnship.in), a AI powered webapp which lets you convert natural language into SQL Query.
Now, my interest is more into building and shipping products
